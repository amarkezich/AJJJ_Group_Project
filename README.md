# AJJJ_Group_Project
Our team has designed four analytical maps that show the change of birthrate overtime within the last five years from 2012 to 2016.
The purpose of this project is to give the scholarly audiences perception of how certain race populations
have a higher or lower probability of higher or lower birthrate while factoring in education, income and geographic
location through the art of data science. In this analysis, we implemented four maps using R Studio, which showed us the
statistics of child-woman ratio by state per year, income versus child-woman ratio analysis based on income per year for every state,
the changes of child-woman ratio per year for every state, race populations on average over the last five years, and the education
attainment per year for every state.This project was designed by a group of four innovative Informatics students who are passionate
to make a difference in a world through data science. We believe that through this project on birthrate statistics and fields
such as race populations, geographic location and  education and  in the US will allow scholarly audiences to learn, analyze,
and apply the knowledge extracted from big data.
